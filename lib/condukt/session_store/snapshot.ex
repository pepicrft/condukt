defmodule Condukt.SessionStore.Snapshot do
  @moduledoc """
  Serializable session snapshot persisted by session stores.

  A snapshot carries its own `:version`, and that is the field that matters
  most. Once a snapshot exists on someone's disk the shape is no longer free to
  change, and a record that does not say which shape it is leaves no way to read
  an old one except guessing. `migrate/1` is the only supported way to turn a
  loaded term back into a snapshot, so every store gets the same handling
  whether it wrote the term yesterday or a year ago.

  `:id` and `:actor` exist for the same reason. A snapshot without them can be
  restored but not attributed, which is enough for a single user resuming their
  own terminal and not enough for anything that holds sessions on behalf of
  more than one person. `:actor` is opaque to Condukt: a host puts whatever
  identifies the owner in it and gets it back untouched.
